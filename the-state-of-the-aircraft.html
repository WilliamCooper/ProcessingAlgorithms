<p>The primary sources of information on the location and motion of the aircraft are inertial navigation systems and global positioning systems. Both are described in this section, and combined results that merge the best features of each into composite variables for location and motion are also discussed. Useful references for material in this section are <a href="http://nldr.library.ucar.edu/repository/assets/technotes/TECH-NOTE-000-000-000-064.pdf">Lenschow (1972)</a> and <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8152">RAF Bulletin 23</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Inertial Reference Systems<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#inertial-reference-systems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>An Inertial Navigation System (INS) or Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) provides measurements of aircraft position, velocity relative to the Earth, acceleration and attitude or orientation. The IRU provides basic measurements of acceleration and angular rotation rate, while the INS integrates those measurements to track the position, altitude, velocity, and orientation of the aircraft. For the GV, the system is a Honeywell Laseref IV HG2001 GD03 Inertial Reference System; for the C-130, it is a Honeywell Model HG1095-AC03 Laseref V SM Inertial Reference System. These systems are described on the EOL web site, at <a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/inertial-navigation-system-aka-inertial-reference-unit">this URL</a>. Data from the IRS come via a serial digital bit stream (the ARINC digital bus) to the <a name='ads'>ADS</a> (Aircraft Data System). Because there is some delay in transmission and recording of these variables, adjustments for this delay are made when the measurements are merged into the processed data files, as documented in the NetCDF header files and as discussed in Section <a href="general-information.html#synchronization-of-measurements">2.3</a>. Typical delays are about 80 ms for variables including ACINS, PITCH, ROLL, and THDG.</p>
<p>Some variables from the inertial reference systems are recorded only on the original “raw” data tapes and are not usually included in final archived data files; these are discussed at the end of this subsection. See also the discussion in Section <a href="obsolete-variables.html#obsolete-variables">10</a> for information on results from inertial systems that were used prior to installation of the present Honeywell systems.<span id="punch3.1" label="punch3.1"></span></p>
<p>An Inertial Navigation System “aligns” before flight, while the aircraft is stationary, by measurement of the variations in its reference frame caused by the rotation of the Earth. Small inaccuracy in that alignment leads to a “Schuler oscillation” that produces oscillatory errors in position and other measurements, with a period <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{Sch}\)</span> of about 84 minutes (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_{Sch}=2\pi\sqrt{R_{E}/g}\)</span>). Position errors of less than <span class="math inline">\(1.0\,\)</span>n mi/h are within normal operating specifications. See Section <a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#combining-irs-and-gps-measurements">3.4</a> for discussion of additional variables, similar to the following, for which corrections are made for these errors via reference to data from a Global Positioning System.</p>
<p>Some projects have used smaller Systron Donner C-MIGITS Inertial Navigation Systems with GPS coupling, usually in connection with special instruments like a wing-mounted wind-sensing system. For these units, variable names usually begin with the letter C but otherwise have names matching the following variables (e.g., CLAT). GPS coupling via a Kalman filter is incorporated in the measurements from these units. They are described at <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/c-migits-insgps-system">this web address</a>. These measurements and variables are linked to non-standard instruments, so the are not documented in this technical report.</p>
<p>Uncertainties associated with measurements from the IRS are discussed in a Technical Note available at <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5065/D60G3HJ8">this URL</a>. See page 7 of that document and the tables on pages 41 and 49.</p>

<p>Primary GPS variables specifying the position and velocity of the aircraft are provided by GPS receivers, currently a NovAtel Model OEM 5 unit on the GV and a NovAtel Model OEM-4 receiver on the C-130 (to be replaced by an OEM-6 after January 2014). See <a href="http://www.eol.ucar.edu/instruments/research-global-positioning-system">this link</a> for a description of these systems. The coordinate system used for all GPS measurements is the World Geodetic System WGS-84; for details, see <a href="http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf">this reference</a>.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a>
The uncertainty of the position measurements is specified by the manufacturer to be 1.5 m CEP horizontal (3.3 m 95% CEP).<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>
The accuracy of velocity measurements is 0.03 m/s RMS for all axes. All variables are provided by the GPS receivers at 5 Hz. Latitude and longitude are recorded in a special log file (called the GPGGA log) with a resolution of 0.0001 degree, while Earth-relative velocity is recorded in the GPRMC log with resolution of 0.1 m/s. Starting in January 2014 new logs (named BESTPOS and BESTVEL) have also been recorded to preserve more significant digits in the measurements. The BESTPOS log has a position resolution of <span class="math inline">\(10^{-11}\,^{\circ}\)</span>, while the BESTVEL log is recorded with 0.0001 m/s resolution.</p>
<p>Some of the following variables are also available from alternate Garmin GPS16 receivers, for which the variable name is qualified by the name of that unit; e.g., GGLAT_GMN for GGLAT as measured by a Garmin GPS unit. In addition, some of the measurements from the GPS units that are part of the aircraft avionics systems are recorded; these are denoted by a suffix “_G” or “_A”. Measurements from before about 2000 used Trimble TANS-III receivers, <span id="punch3.3" label="punch3.3"></span>with the ability to track up to 6 satellites at a time but needing only 4 to provide 3-dimensional position and velocity data (3 satellites for 2-dimensions). The accuracy of the position measurements for that unit was stated to be 25 meters (horizontal) and 35 meters (vertical) under “steady-state conditions.”<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>
Likewise, velocity measurements are within 0.2 m/s for all axes. Measurement resolution is that of 4-byte IEEE format (about 6 significant digits). All variables were provided by the Trimble receivers at 1 Hz.</p>
<p>A special correction is needed for variables GGVEW, GGVNS, and GGVSPD, which measure the motion <em>at the GPS antenna</em> relative to the Earth. The conventional wind calculation addresses the difference between the motion at the radome (where the relative wind is measured) and the INS (where variables VEW, VNS, VSPD are measured) arising from rotation of the aircraft. However, if GGVSPD is used instead of VSPD for vertical wind or GGVEW and GGVNS are used (perhaps via the complementary filter) for the horizontal wind, an additional correction is needed for the displacement between the GPS antenna and the INS receiver. On the GV, this distance is -4.30 m. A correction for aircraft rotation is therefore applied to GGVSPD, as described below.</p>

<h4>Altitude, Reference (m MSL): ALTX (Obsolete), GGALTC (Obsolete)<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#altx" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>Derived altitude above the geopotential surface,</em> obtained by combining information from a GPS receiver and an inertial reference system. This variable was intended to compensate for times when GPS reception was lost by incorporating information from the IRS measurement of altitude. GPS status measurements were used to detect signal loss, although sometimes this signal was delayed for a few seconds after the signal was lost. A 10-second running average was calculated of the difference between the GPS altitude and the reference altitude. When the sample-to-sample altitude difference changed more than 50 meters or when the GPS status detected a degraded signal, the derived variable (ALTX or GGALTC) became the alternate reference altitude adjusted by the latest running-average difference between that reference altitude and GGALT. When reception was recovered, to avoid a sudden discontinuity in altitude, the derived variable was adjusted back to the GPS altitude gradually over the next 10 seconds.<br />
This obsolete variable should be used with caution because the reference altitude used in past calculations was the IRS altitude updated to the pressure altitude of the aircraft. To account for the difference between pressure and geometric altitude, a regression equation was used, normally <span class="math inline">\(z=a_0+a_1\times{PALT}\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a_0=-46.3\,m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a_1=0.97866\)</span> but occasionally adjusted dependent on project conditions. This introduced problems in early applications with the GV because it did not account for the pressure-altitude transition at the ISA tropopause. Use of a pressure altitude as reference introduces additional errors in altitude in regions that are not barotropic.</p>

<p>Measurements from the global positioning and inertial navigation systems are combined to produce new variables that take advantage of the strengths of each, so that the resulting variables have the long-term stability of the GPS and the short-term resolution of the INS. This section describes some variables that result from this blending of variables. These corrected variables are usually the best available when the GPS and IRS are both functioning.</p>
<p>One can determine if the GPS is functioning by examining the GPS status variables described in the previous section or by looking for spikes or “flat-lines” in the data. If the GPS data are missing for a short time (a few seconds to a minute), accuracy is not affected. However, longer dropouts will result in uncertainties degrading toward those of the INS. Without the GPS or another ground reference, the IRS error cannot be determined empirically, and one should assume that it is within the manufacturer’s specification (1 nautical mile of error per hour of flight, 90% CEP). When the GPS is active, RAF estimates that the correction algorithm produces a position with an error less than 1.5 m. The error will increase from about 1.5 meters to the INS specification in about one-half hour after GPS information is lost.</p>

<h4>GPS-Corrected Inertial Ground Speed Vector (m/s): VEWC, VNSC<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#vewc-vnsc" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>These variables result from combining GPS and INS output of the east and north components of ground speed from a <span id="compFilter">complementary-filter</span> algorithm. Positive values are toward the east and north, respectively. The smooth, high-resolution, continuous measurements from the inertial navigation system, {VNS, VEW}, which can slowly accumulate errors over time, are combined with the measurements from the GPS, {GVNS, GVEW}, which have good long-term stability, via an approach based on a complementary filter. A low-pass filter <span class="math inline">\(F_L(\{GVNS, GVEW\})\)</span> is applied to the GPS measurements of groundspeed, which are assumed to be valid for frequencies at or lower than the cutoff frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span> of the filter. Then the complementary high-pass filter, denoted <span class="math inline">\((1-F_L)(\{VNS, VEW\})\)</span>, is applied to the IRS measurements of groundspeed, which are assumed valid for frequencies at or higher than <span class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span>. Ideally, the transition frequency would be selected where the GPS errors (increasing with frequency) are equal to the IRS errors (decreasing with frequency).</p>
<p>The procedure is use now is documented in the <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5065/D60G3HJ8">Technical Note on Wind Uncertainty</a>, beginning on p. 125. The filter is a three-pole Butterworth low-pass filter, originally coded following the algorithm described in Bosic, S. M., 1980: <em>Digital and Kalman filtering : An Introduction to Discrete-Time Filtering and Optimum Linear Estimation,</em> p. 49. As described in <a href="www/checkCompFilter.pdf">this memo</a>, it has been revised (2014) to use coefficients generated by the R routine “butter().” The digital filter used is recursive, not centered, to permit calculation during a single pass through the data. If the cutoff frequency lies where both the GPS and INS measurements are almost the same, then the detailed characteristics of the filter (e.g., phase shift) in the transition region do not matter because the complementary filters have canceling effects when applied to the same signal. The transition frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span> was chosen to be (1/600) Hz. The Butterworth filter was chosen because it provides flat response away from the transition.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>

<p>This result is used as long as the GPS signals are continuous and flagged as being valid. When that is not the case, some means is needed to avoid sudden discontinuities in velocity (and hence wind speed), which would introduce spurious effects into variance spectra and other properties dependent on a continuously valid measurement of wind. To extrapolate measurements through periods when the GPS signals are lost (as sometimes occurs, for example, in turns) a fit is determined to the difference between the best-estimate variables {VNSC,VEWC} and the IRS variables {VNS,VEW} for the period before GPS reception was lost, and that fit is used to extrapolate through periods when GPS reception is not available. The procedure is as described below:<br />
<span id="punch3.15" label="punch3.15"></span></p>
<p class="box">
 1. If GPS reception has never been valid earlier in the flight, use the INS values without correction.<br />
 2. Whenever both GPS and INS are good, update the low-pass-filtered estimate of the difference between them. This is added to the INS measurement to obtain the corrected variable. Also update a least-squares fit to the difference between the GPS and INS groundspeeds, for each component. The errors are assumed to result primarily from a Schuler oscillation, so the three-term fit is of the form <span class="math inline">\(\Delta=a_1+a_2\sin(\Omega_{Sch}t)+a_3\cos(\Omega_{Sch}t)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\Omega_{Sch}\)</span> is the angular frequency of the Schuler oscillation (taken to be <span class="math inline">\(2\pi/5067\)</span> s, and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is the time since the start of the flight. A separate fit is used for each component of the velocity and each component of the position (discussed below under LATC and LONC). The <span id="fit-matrix">fit matrix</span> used to determine these coefficients is updated each time step but the accumulated fit factors decay exponentially with a 30-min decay constant, so the terms used to determine the fit are exponentially weighted over the period of valid data with a time constant that decays exponentially into the past with a characteristic time of 30 min. This is long enough to determine a significant portion of the Schuler oscillation but short enough to emphasize recent measurements of the correction.<br />
 3. When GPS data become invalid, if sufficient data (spanning 30 min) have been accumulated, invert the accumulated fit matrices to determine the coefficients {<span class="math inline">\(a_1,a_2,a_3\)</span>} and then use the formula for <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> in the preceding step to extrapolate the correction to the IRS measurements while the GPS measurements remain invalid. Doing so immediately would introduce a discontinuity in {VNSC,VEWC}, however, so the correction <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> is introduced smoothly by adjusting {VNSC, VEWC} as follows: If <span class="math inline">\(dvy\)</span> is the adjustment added to the INS measurement, adjust it according to
<span class="math inline">\(dvy^\prime=\eta\ dvy+(1-\eta)\Delta\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(dvy^\prime\)</span> is the sequentially adjusted correction and <span class="math inline">\(\eta=0.995\)</span> s<span class="math inline">\(^{-1}\)</span> is chosen to give a decaying transition with a time constant of about 5.5 min. This has the potential to introduce some artificial variance at this scale and so should be considered in cases where variance spectra are analyzed in detail, but it has much less influence on such spectra than a discontinuous transition would. Ideally, the current fit and the last filtered discrepancy (VNSC<sub>0</sub><span class="math inline">\(-\)</span>GVNS<sub>0</sub> should be about equal, so transitioning between them should not introduce a significant change.<br />
 4. To avoid transients that would result from switching abruptly to the complementary-filter solution when the GPS measurements again become valid, the correction factors (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(dvy\)</span>) are also updated smoothly toward the complementary-filter solution, using for example <span class="math inline">\(dvy^\prime=\eta\ dvy+(1-\eta)F_L(v_y^{GPS}-v_y^{IRS})\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(F_L\)</span> is the low-pass filter and <span class="math inline">\(v_y\)</span> is the northward component of aircraft groundspeed.

<li id="fn8"><p>For earlier projects using the Litton LTN-51 INS, this is a direct measurement without adjustment for changes in gravity during flight and without pressure-damping. Previous use employed a baro-inertial loop to compensate for drift in the integrated measurement. See the discussion of WP3 below.<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Regarding signs, note that ACINS is a number near zero, not near g, and so already has the estimated acceleration of gravity removed. The assumption made in the following is that the INS will report values adjusted for the gravitational acceleration <em>at the point of alignment</em>, which would be <span class="math inline">\(G_L\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(g_f\)</span>, the estimate for gravity at the flight altitude (palt) and latitude (lat), is <em>smaller</em> than <span class="math inline">\(G_L\)</span> then the difference (<span class="math inline">\(G_L-g_f\)</span>) will be positive; this will correct for the reference value for ACINS being the gravity measured at alignment when it should actually be the sensed gravity at the measurement point, so to obtain (sensed acceleration - <span class="math inline">\(g_f\)</span>) it is necessary to add (<span class="math inline">\(G_L-g_f\)</span>) to ACINS, <em>increasing</em> “acz” in this case. However, the situation with “vcorac” is reversed: “vcorac” is a positive term for all eastward flight, for example, but in that case the motion of the aircraft makes objects seem lighter (i.e., they experience less acceleration of gravity) than without such flight. ACINS is positive upward so it represents a net acceleration of the aircraft upward (as imposed by the combination of gravity and the lift force of the aircraft). To accomplish level flight in these circumstances, the aircraft must actually accelerate downward so the accelerometer will experience a negative excursion relative to slower flight. To compensate, “vcorac” must make a positive contribution to remove that negative excursion from “acz”. In the conceptual extreme that the aircraft flies fast enough for the interior to appear weightless, ACINS would reduce to <span class="math inline">\(-G_L\)</span> and vcorac would increase to <span class="math inline">\(+G_L\)</span>, leaving acz near zero as required if the aircraft were to remain in level flight in the rotating frame.<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>Because GV flights can span considerable distances, if these variables are used in the future it may be preferable to consider great-circle routes and spherical-triangle relationships for these calculations. Appropriate equations are available <a href="www/sphCoord.pdf">here</a>.<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>There are four measures of height or altitude discussed in this technical note, height relative to the WGS-84 reference surface, geometric height relative to mean sea level, geopotential height and pressure height. The WGS-84 height (measured by GPS instruments) is height relative to a reference system in which zero is defined by a specified reference ellipsoid representing the shape of the Earth, as specified here: <a href="https://earth-info.nga.mil/index.php?dir=wgs84&amp;action=wgs84">WGS-84</a>. This is not defined to be a level surface in the sense of being an equipotential surface. A better approximation of mean sea level is the “geoid”, a surface having constant gravitational equipotential that approximates mean sea level. The geoid is more structured than the WSR-84 reference ellipsoid and departs significantly from it, often by several 10s of meters. Even the geoid does not represent mean sea level exactly because local mean sea level can be influenced by variations in water density, mean wind, or ocean circulation, but the geoid is usually the reference used for measurements labeled “MSL” except when fine-scale local effects must be considered. The geometric height is the true height above a reference surface, often taken to be mean sea level or the geoid; this may therefore differ significantly from the height measured directly by a GPS unit. There is a variable included below, GGEOIDHT, that provides a measure of the difference. Geopotential height is the height above mean sea level that would give the geopotential, or gravitational potential energy per unit mass, of the actual parcel if that mass were raised against standard gravity (not varying, e.g., with latitude or height) to that altitude. For the purpose of this definition, standard gravity is defined to be 9.80665 m s<sup>-2</sup>. Finally, pressure altitude, defined in detail below, is the altitude in the ISA Standard Atmosphere where the pressure matches a specified value; it is not a geometric coordinate but rather a measure of pressure.<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>CEP is the Circular Error Probability, the radius of a circle that contains 50% of the measurements; 95% CEP contains 95% of the measurements. When OnmiSTAR corrections are available (involving extra cost and not available in all areas of the globe, so not available for all projects) the uncertainty decreases to 0.15 m 95% CEP. The vertical uncertainty is about twice as great as the horizontal uncertainty. Because variables are stored as 4-byte single-precision floating point numbers, the inherent storage precision can limit the precision of the recorded position to about 1 m.<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>The GPS signals at one time suffered from “selective availability,” a US DOD term for a perturbed signal that degraded GPS absolute accuracy to 100 meters. This was especially noticeable in the altitude measurement, so GALT normally was not useful. As of 1 May 2000, selective availability was deactivated to allow everyone to obtain better position measurements. See the Interagency GPS Executive Board web site for more information on selective availability and GPS measurements prior to 2000.<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

<li id="fn15"><p>Prior to and including some projects in 2010, processing used slightly different coefficients: for aircraft other than the GV, <span class="math inline">\(T_0/\lambda=-43308.83\)</span>, the reference pressure <span class="math inline">\(p_0=1013.246\)</span> and the exponent <span class="math inline">\(x=0.190284\)</span>. For the GV, <span class="math inline">\(T_0/\lambda=44308/0\)</span>, the transition pressure was <span class="math inline">\(p_T=226/1551\)</span> hPa, <span class="math inline">\(x=0.190284\)</span> and the value of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{R_{0}^{\prime}T_{T}}{gM_{d}}\)</span> was set to 6340.70 m instead of 6341.620 m as obtained below. The difference between these older values and the ones recommended below is everywhere less than 10 m and so is small compared to the expected uncertainty in pressure measurements, because 1 hPa change in pressure leads to a change in pressure altitude that varies from about 8–40 m over the altitude range of the GV.<a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
