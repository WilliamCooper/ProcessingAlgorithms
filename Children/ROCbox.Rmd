$g^{\dagger}$ = acceleration of gravity (see Eq. \@ref(eq:gsublambda))  
$R_{d}{}^{\dagger}$ = gas constant for dry air  
$T_{K}$ = absolute temperature = (ATX + 273.15)  
$a$ = [ACINS](#acins) = upward acceleration as measured by the INS [m\ s^-2^]  
$p$ = [PSXC](#psx) = measured ambient pressure [hPa]  
$\Delta p$ = difference between current and last value of PSXC  
$\Delta t$ = time between samples (1/$f$ where $f$ is the sample
frequency)  
$F_{L}$ = low-pass Butterworth filter (cf.\ [this discussion](#vewc-vnsc)).

\ 1. From consecutive measurements of pressure, estimate the rate of climb
from the hydrostatic equation:  
\begin{equation}
w_{p}=-\frac{R_{d}T_{k}}{gp}\frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}
(\#eq:wphe)  
\end{equation}  
\ 2. Add the current measurement of acceleration to the cumulative sum:
\begin{equation}
w_{p}^{*}\leftarrow w_{p}^{*}+a\Delta t
(\#eq:wpstar)
\end{equation}  
\ 3. Define ROC as the sum of $w_{p}^{*}$ and the low-pass filtered value
of ($w_{p}-w_{p}^{*}$):  
\begin{align}
\mathrm{ROC} & =w_{p}^{*}+F_{L}(w_{p}-w_{p}^{*})
(\#eq:ROC)  
\end{align}
