[LAT](#latitude) = latitude measured by the IRS  
[LON](#longitude) = longitude measured by the IRS  
[GGLAT](#gglat) = latitude measured by the GPS  
[GGLON](#gglon) = longitude measured by the GPS  
[VNSC](#vewc-vnsc) = aircraft ground speed, north component, corrected  
[VEWC](#vewc-vnsc) = aircraft ground speed, east component, corrected

**1.** Initialize the corrected position at the IRS position at the start of the flight or after
any large change (>5$^\circ$) in the IRS position.\
**2.** Integrate forward from that position using the aircraft groundspeed with components
{VNSC,VEWC}. Note that in the absence of GPS information this will introduce
long-term errors because it does not account for the Earth’s spherical geometry. It
provides good short-term accuracy, but the GPS updating in the next step is needed to
compensate for the difference between a rectilinear frame and the Earth’s spherical
coordinate frame and provides a smooth yet accurate track.\
**3.** Use an exponential adjustment to the GPS position, with time constant that is typically about 100 s.^(a)^\
**4.** To handle periods when the GPS becomes invalid, use an approach analogous to that
for groundspeed, whereby a Schuler-oscillation fit to the difference between the GPS
and IRS measurements is accumulated and used to extrapolate through periods when
the GPS is invalid.\
