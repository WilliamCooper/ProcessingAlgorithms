Measurements of some meteorological state variables like pressure, temperature, and water vapor pressure may originate from multiple sensors mounted at various locations on an aircraft. To distinguish among similar measurements, many variable names incorporate an indication of where the measurement was made. In this document, locations in variable names are represented by “x”, where “x” may be one of the following:

<p>In addition, a true letter ’X’ (not replaced by the above letters) may be appended to a measurement to indicate that it is the preferred choice among similar measurements and is therefore used to calculate derived variables that depend on the measured quantity. Other suffixes sometimes used to distinguish among measurements are these: ’D’ for a digital sensor; ’H’ for a heated (usually, anti-iced) sensor, ’L’ for port-side sensors, and ’R’ for starboard-side sensors.</p>

<h4>Static or Ambient Pressure (hPa): PSx, PSxC, PS_A, PSX, PSXC, PSFD, PSFRD, PSTF<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#psx" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>The atmospheric pressure at the flight level of the aircraft, measured by a calibrated absolute (barometric) transducer at location x.</em> PSx is the measured static or ambient pressure before correction, and it may be affected by local flow-field distortion. PS_A is the pressure measurement taken from the avionics system on the aircraft, processed via unknown algorithms in the avionics system that may smooth, correct, and perhaps delay the result. PSxC is PSx corrected for local flow-field distortion (see <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8150">RAF Bulletin #21</a> and the discussion in <a href="www/PCOR.pdf">this memo</a> and <a href="www/PcorCalculation.pdf">this supplement</a>); PSXC is the preferred corrected measurement used for derived calculations. These measurements have been made using various sensors, so it is best to consult the project documentation for the transducer used. Recent measurements from both the C-130 and the GV have been made using a Paroscientific Model 1000 Digiquartz Transducer.</p>
<p>Corrections to the pressures have been determined by reference to some standard, including a “trailing cone” sensor, the pressure PS_A from the cockpit avionics system, or (since 2012) the Laser Air Motion Sensing System (LAMS). The latter correction is discussed in the memo <a href="www/PCOR.pdf">referenced above</a>, where corrections used prior to 2011 are also discussed. Beginning in 2012, the deduced corrections <em>Δp</em> to the measured pressures as functions of dynamic pressure <em>q</em>, angle of attack <em>α</em>,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a>
and the Mach number <em>M</em> are described by the following equations and coefficients:</p>
<p><strong>For the C-130</strong><a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a>,<br />

where, for <span class="math inline">\(p_m=\{PSFD\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(q_m\)</span> = dynamic pressure {QCF}, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=\{ATTACK\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(a_r=1^\circ\)</span> (included to keep the equation and coefficient dimensionless), and <span class="math inline">\(\{d_{0-4}\}\)</span>={-4.389e-03, -2.966e-02, -6.831e-05, 2.672e-02, 2.4466e-03}.

The latter coefficients are significantly different from the coefficients for PSFD, but the static ports where PSFRD is measured are at a different location on the fuselage so different flow-distortion effects are expected.</p>

In equations <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:PCORC130">(4.1)</a> and <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:PCORforGV">(4.2)</a> the Mach number is calculated from the uncorrected measurements of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, using dry-air values for <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c_v\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c_p\)</span>, via<br />

<p>The pressure PSTF is measured at the static-pressure port of a pitot-static tube mounted on the top of the fuselage. The correction to this pressure (leading to PSTFC) differs from the pressure corrections listed above in that it is based on an empirical fit to other measurements of static pressure. The airflow at that sensor is distorted by the fuselage, so that measurement is usually less reliable than other measures of static pressure. See <a href="www/WindInSOCRATES.pdf">this note</a> for additional discussion of this measurement.</p>
<p>For additional information on these correction coefficients, see <a href="www/ARISTO-LAMS.pdf">this note</a> and Cooper et al. (2014).<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p><em>The pressure excess caused by bringing the airflow to rest relative to the aircraft.</em> These quantities represent the difference between the total pressure <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> as measured at the inlet of a pitot tube or other forward-pointing port and the ambient pressure that would be present in the absence of motion through the air. The variable QC_A is provided by the avionic data system and is subject to an unknown delay and smoothing. The variables ending in “C” have been corrected for flow-distortion effects, mostly arising from errors in the measurement of static pressure. Since 2012, the corrections are based on measurements from the LAMS system as described for PSxC, and they have the same functional form as in <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:PCORC130">(4.1)</a> and

The same correction is applied to QCR because it is also measured relative to the static pressure ports so errors in the pressure sensed at those ports affect QCR in the same way that QCF is affected. <span id="punch4.3" label="punch4.3">[ToDo4.3]</span>See the notes referenced in the preceding section, and also <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8150">RAF Bulletin 21</a> for the corrections applied to earlier data files.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>In the case of QCRC from the GV, one additional correction is applied (beginning 2017). The uncorrected measurement QCR is affected by flow angles, while QCF is not (for modest angle of attack or sideslip), so an additional adjustment is needed. The needed correction can be found by using an empirical relationship matching QCR to QCF, which leads to the following equation:<br />
<span class="math display" id="eq:PCORforQCR">\[\begin{equation}

A similar correction is not made for measurements from the C-130 radome because they do not appear to be necessary, as discussed in that note.</p>
<p>The measurement QCTF is made at the dynamic-pressure port of a pitot-static sensor mounted on the top of the fuselage. Because this is located in a region of airflow distortion around the fuselage of the GV, special processing is required. The method proposed in <a href="www/WindInSOCRATES.pdf">this note</a> is to calculate a corrected dynamic pressure from QCTFC=QCTF+PSTF-PSXC. For high-rate files, PSXC is low-pass-filtered with a cut-off frequency of 0.5 Hz to eliminate high-frequency noise in this measurement.</p>

<h4>Recovery Temperature (ºC): RTx, RTxH, RTHRx, RTX<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#recovery-t" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>The recovery temperature is the temperature sensed by a temperature probe that is exposed to the atmosphere.</em> In flight, the temperature is heated above the ambient temperature because it senses the temperature of air near the sensor that has been heated adiabatically during compression as it is brought near the airspeed of the aircraft. These variables are the measurements of that recovery temperature from calibrated temperature sensors at location x, for processing prior to about 2012; more recently, the names are simply RTF# or RTH# where # is a number starting with 1.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a>
For Rosemount or HARCO temperature probes in current use, the recovery temperature is near the total temperature, but all probes must be corrected to obtain either true total temperature or true ambient temperature. In the standard output, the variable name also conveys the sensor type: RTF# or RTx is a measurement from a Rosemount Model 102 non-deiced temperature sensor, RT#H or RTxH is the measurement from a Rosemount Model 102 anti-iced (heated) temperature sensor, and RTH# or RTHx is the measurement from a HARCO heated sensor. The aircraft avionics system also provides a measured recovery temperature, named RT_A. Some past experiments also used a reverse-flow temperature housing and a fast-response “K” housing; the associated variable names for these probes were TTRF and TTKP.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

<h4>Ambient Temperature (<sup>∘</sup>C): ATx, ATX, ATxH<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#ambient-t" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>The temperature of the atmosphere at the location of the aircraft, as it would be measured by a sensor at rest relative to the air.</em></p>
<p>The ’x’ in the name of the variable used for ambient temperature, ATx, conveys the same information regarding sensor type and location as the variable name used with total (recovery) temperature. See the discussion above regarding RTx. Variable names that appear in project archives include ATF, ATF1, AFT2, ATH, ATH1, ATH2, ATH3, ATH4, ATHL1, ATHL2, ATFH1, ATFH2, ATFR, ATRL, and ATRR. The VCSEL hygrometer incorporates a temperature sensor (AT_VXL or AT_VXL2), with measurements recorded in units of kelvin. The measurements of ambient temperature (also known as the static air temperature), except AT_VXL and AT_VXL2, are calculated from measured recovery temperatures, which are increased above the ambient temperatures by dynamic heating caused by the airspeed of the aircraft. The calculated temperature therefore depends on the recovery temperature RTx as well as the dynamic and ambient pressure, usually respectively QCXC and PSXC. The ambient and dynamic pressures are first corrected from the raw measurements QCX and PSX to obtain variables that account for deviations caused by airflow around the aircraft and/or position-dependent systematic errors, as discussed in the section describing PSxC. In addition, the aircraft avionics provides estimates of air temperature (AT_A and AT_A2).</p>
<p>The following basic equations are developed on the basis of conservation of energy for a perfect gas undergoing an adiabatic compression. This section combines discussion of the calculations of temperature and <a name=airspeed1>airspeed</a>, to reflect the linkage between these derived measurements. To provide accuracy in the equations, this discussion considers effects of the humidity of the air on characteristics like the gas constant and the specific heats. Most archived data before 2012 used values for dry air, although a special variable TASHC has been used to represent the true airspeed in cases where the humidity correction was significant. That variable was based on a good approximation to the results from the following equations; see the discussion of TASHC later in this section. TASHC is now considered an obsolete variable. New variables ATxD and TASDRY have been introduced that neglect the humidity corrections and perform all calculations as if the humidity were negligible<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a>.</p>
As discussed above, temperature sensors on aircraft that are exposed to the airflow do not measure the total temperature but rather the temperature of the air immediately in contact with the sensing element. This air will not have undergone an adiabatic deceleration completely to zero velocity relative to the sensor and hence will have a temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_r\)</span> somewhat less than the total temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_t\)</span> that would require the air to reach zero velocity relative to the sensor. <span class="math inline">\(T_r\)</span> is the measured or “recovery” temperature.

Moist-Air Considerations <br><br>
Primes on the symbols denote that these values should be moist-air
values, appropriately weighted averages of the dry-air and water-vapor
contributions. The practice prior to 2014 was to use the dry-air values
for specific heats and the gas constant, except as described in connection
with TASHC below. Since 2014, calculations use the appropriate values
for moist air, except that to avoid errors introduced by unrealistically
high measurements of humidity the humidity correction was limited

<p>The temperature sensors used on RAF aircraft are designed to decelerate the air adiabatically to near zero velocity. Recovery factors determined from wind tunnel testing for the Rosemount sensors are approximately 0.97 (unheated model) and 0.98 (heated models).<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a>
These values have also been confirmed from flight maneuvers, often from “speed runs” where the aircraft is flown level through its speed range and the variation of recovery temperature with airspeed is used with <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:Tair">(4.12)</a>, with the assumption that <span class="math inline">\(T_a\)</span> remains constant, to determine the recovery factor. Data files and project reports normally document what recovery factor was used for calculating the true <a name=airspeed2>airspeed</a> and ambient temperature for a particular project.</p>
<p>Because the values used in processing have varied, the project reports should be consulted to find what was used for particular projects.

Some studies of the recovery factor are discussed further in <a href="www/RecoveryFactorStudy2021.pdf">this memo</a>.</p>
<p>The true airspeed <span class="math inline">\(U_a\)</span> is used in <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:Tair">(4.12)</a> to calculate the ambient temperature <span class="math inline">\(T_a\)</span>. However, the ambient temperature is also needed to calculate the true airspeed. Therefore the constraints imposed on ambient temperature and true airspeed by the measurements of recovery temperature, total pressure (the pressure measured by a pitot tube pointed into the airstream and assumed to be that obtained when the incoming air is brought to rest relative to the aircraft), and ambient pressure must be used to solve simultaneously for the two unknowns, temperature and airspeed.</p>
<p>The relationship is conveniently derived by first calculating the dimensionless Mach number <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, which is the ratio of the <a name=airspeed3>airspeed</a> to the speed of sound <span class="math inline">\(U_{s}=\sqrt{\gamma^{\prime}R^{\prime}T_{a}}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^\prime\)</span> is the ratio of specific heats of (moist) air, <span class="math inline">\(c_p^\prime /c_v^\prime\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R^\prime\)</span> is the gas constant for moist air. The Mach number is a function of air temperature only and can be determined as follows:</p>
<p>a). Express energy conservation, as in <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:Tair">(4.12)</a>, in the form<br />

where the total derivatives apply along a streamline as <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> changes from <span class="math inline">\(U_a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(U_t=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> changes from <span class="math inline">\(T_a\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(T_t\)</span>.<br />
b).

Using this expression for <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in the formula for <span class="math inline">\(dT\)</span> and then integrating both total derivatives in <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:econ">(4.15)</a> along the streamline leads to<br />

where <span class="math inline">\(p_t\)</span> is the total pressure (i.e., PSXC+QCXC) and

c). Use the above definition of the Mach number <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(M=U_a/U_s\)</span>) in the form

<p><em>The mirror temperature measured directly by a dew-point sensor</em> without correction. The dew point or frost point is measured by either an EG&amp;G Model 137, a General Eastern Model 1011B or a Buck Model 1011C dew-point hygrometer. Variables DPx (like DPB) haven’t been used since 2008. A status variable BALNC sometimes records the quality of the balance maintaned by the thermoelectric coolers and the target coverage of condensate on the sensing mirrors. Below 0<sup>o</sup>C the instrument is assumed to be responding to the frost point, although occasionally in climbs there is a short transition near the freezing level before the condensate on the mirror of the instrument freezes and there may be a measurement error before the condensate freezes. The measurements are usually made within a housing where the pressure (<span class="math inline">\(p_h\)</span>) may differ from the ambient pressure, so the pressure in the housing affects the measured dew point or frost point. The housing pressure is often adjusted to be near the ambient pressure by appropriate orientation of inlets, and recently the pressure in the housing is measured and a correction is applied, as discussed in the next paragraph.</p>

<h4>Corrected Dew Point (ºC): DPXC, DPxC<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#dewpt-corrected" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>The dew point obtained from the original measurement after correction for the housing pressure, the enhancement of the equilibrium vapor pressure arising from the total pressure (discussed below), and conversion from frost point if appropriate.</em> The result is the temperature at which the equilibrium vapor pressure over a plane water surface in the absence of other gases would match the actual water-vapor pressure. Dew/frost-point hygrometers measure the equilibrium point in the presence of air, and the presence of air affects the measurement in a minor way that is represented by a small correction here named the “enhancement factor.” In the case where the dew-point or frost-point sensor is exposed to ambient air directly, the enhancement factor is defined so that the ambient water vapor pressure <span class="math inline">\(e_a\)</span> is related to <span class="math inline">\(T_p\)</span>, the <em>measured</em> dew or frost point <em>in the presence of air</em> having total pressure <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, by <span class="math inline">\(e_a=f(p,T_P)e_s(T_p)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(e_s(T_p)\)</span> is the vapor pressure in equilibrium with ice or water at the dew or frost point <span class="math inline">\(T_p\)</span> <em>in the absence of air.</em> Calculation of DPxC removes this dependence, so the vapor pressure obtained from <span class="math inline">\(e_s(\{DPxC\})\)</span> will be that vapor pressure corresponding to equilibrium <em>in the absence of air.</em> In addition, if the measurement is below <span class="math inline">\(0^\circ\mathrm{C}\)</span>, it is assumed to be a measurement of frost point and a corresponding dew point is calculated from the measurement (also with correction for the influence of the total pressure on the measurement). Some changes were made to these calculations in 2011; for more information, see <a href="www/VaporPressureV3.pdf">this memo</a>.</p>
<p>An additional correction is needed in those cases where the pressure in the housing of the instrument (measured as PSDPx or CAVP_x) differs from the ambient pressure, because the changed pressure affects the partial pressure of water vapor in proportion to the change in total pressure and so changes the measured dew point from the desired quantity (that in the ambient air) to that in the housing. This is especially important in the case of the GV because the potential effect increases with airspeed. If the pressure in the housing is measured or otherwise known (e.g., from correlations with other measurements), then this correction can be introduced into the processing algorithm at the same time that the correction for the presence of dry air is introduced, and the enhancement factor should be evaluated at the pressure in the housing. In some cases before this measurement was available, an estimate of the cavity pressure was used instead by considering empirical expressions representing this cavity pressures after the measurement was implemented; the cavity pressures based on those empirical relationships have names like CAVPE_x where x is, for example, DPB.</p>
<p>The relationship between water-vapor pressure and dew- or frost-point temperature is based on the Murphy and Koop<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a>

Because processing to obtain the corrected dew point DPxC from the ambient vapor pressure <span class="math inline">\(e_a\)</span> would require difficult inversion of the above formulas, interpolation is used instead.

<h4>Water Vapor Number Density from the UV Hygrometer (molecules cm<sup>-3</sup>): CONCH_UVH<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#uvh-n" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>Water vapor molecular density</em> (concentration of water molecules) measured by the UV Hygrometer. This is the direct measurement from the instrument. Its calculation relies on a bench calibration that fits the water vapor number density to the Beers-Lambert absorption law and corrects for output offsets and the effect of UV absorption by atmospheric constituents other than water vapor. See also the discussion of EW_UVH in the paragraph that immediately follows.</p>

<p><em>The ambient vapor pressure of water,</em> also used in the calculation of several derived variables. It is often obtained from an instrument measuring dew point or water vapor density. In the case where it is derived from a measurement of dew point (DPx), a correction is applied for the enhancement factor that influences dew point or frost point measurements<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a>.
The formula for obtaining the ambient water vapor pressure as a function of dew point is given in the discussion of DPxC above, Eqs. <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:MKw">(4.23)</a> and <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:enhance">(4.24)</a>, where the calculations leading to EWx and EWX are also discussed. EWX (or previously EDPC) is the preferred variable that is selected from among the possibilities {EWx} for subsequent calculation of derived variables.</p>
<p>For the VCSEL hygrometer, EW_VXL is determined from CONCV_VXL as follows:
<span class="math display" id="eq:VCSELew">\[\begin{equation}
\{\mathrm{EW\_VXL}\} = C^\prime k\,\{\mathrm{CONCV\_VXL}\}\times (\{\mathrm{ATX}\}+273.15)
\tag{4.30}
\end{equation}\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the Boltzmann constant and <span class="math inline">\(C^\prime=(\mathrm{100cm/m})^3(\mathrm{hPa/100Pa})=10^4\)</span> converts units to hPa.</p>
<p>In the case where the water vapor pressure is determined from the UV Hygrometer data, this variable is calculated using one of two methods:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Using the ideal gas law to convert the water vapor number density from the UV Hygrometer to water vapor pressure, using XCELLTEMP_UVH and XCELLPRES_UVH, the measured temperature and pressure in the absorption cell, via the equation:<br />
<span class="math display" id="eq:UVH1">\[\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\{EW\_UVH\}=C\,\{CONC\_UVH\}\notag \\
\times\frac{k\,(\mathrm{\{XCELLTEMP\_UVH\}+273.15)\,\mathrm{\{PSX\}}}}{\mathrm{{\{XCELLPRES\_UVH\}}}}}
\tag{4.31}
\end{equation}\]</span>
</span><br /> or<br />
</li>
<li>Through use of a polynomial fit with coefficients fitted to {EWX}:<br />
<span class="math display" id="eq:UVH2">\[\begin{equation}
\mathrm{\{EWX\}}=c_0 + c_1(\mathrm{\{XSIGV\_UVH\}}) + c_2(\mathrm{\{XSIGV\_UVH\}}^2)
\tag{4.32}
\end{equation}\]</span><br />
where {EWX} is a reference water vapor pressure provided by another instrument. This preserves the fast-response characteristics of the UV hygrometer while linking the absolute values to a baseline provided by a more stable instrument. This can be done on a flight-by-flight basis and largely eliminates drift.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a>

<p>For the Lyman-alpha probes and the newer Lyman-alpha version called the UV hygrometer, the basic measurement from the instrument is the water vapor density, <strong>RHOUV</strong> or <strong>RHOLA,</strong> determined by applying calibration coefficients to the measured signals (XUVI or VLA). In addition, a slow update to a dew-point measurement is used to compensate for drift in the calibration. The algorithm for the UV Hygrometer is as described in the following box; the processing used for early projects with the Lyman-alpha instruments is similar but more involved and won’t be documented here because the instruments are obsolete. See <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8729">RAF Bulletin 9</a> for the processing previously used for archived measurements from the Lyman-alpha hygrometers.</p>
<p class="box">
This algorithm for RHOUV is missing.

<p>For the VCSEL hygrometer, the original measurement is the water-vapor molecular density, corrected to ambient temperature.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.7</span> Wind<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#wind" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8152">RAF Bulletin 23</a> documents the calculation of wind components, both with respect to the earth (UI, VI, WI, WS and WD) and with respect to the aircraft (UX and VY). In data processing, a separate function (GUSTO in GENPRO, gust.c in NIMBUS) is used to derive these wind components. That function uses the measurements from an Inertial Navigation System (INS) as well as aircraft true <a name=airspeed5>airspeed</a>, aircraft angle of attack, and aircraft sideslip angle. The wind components calculated in GUSTO/gust.c are used to derive the wind direction (WD) and wind speed (WS). Additional variables UIC, VIC, WSC, WDC, UXC, and VYC are also calculated based on the variables VNSC, VEWC discussed in Section <a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#combining-irs-and-gps-measurements">3.4</a>, which combine INS and GPS information to obtain improved measurements of the aircraft motion. Those are usually the highest-quality measurements of wind because the merged INS/GPS variables combine the high-frequency response of the INS with the long-term accuracy of the GPS.</p>
<p>There is an extensive discussion of the wind-sensing system and the uncertainties associated with measurements of wind in this <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5065/D60G3HJ8">Technical Note</a>. The details contained therein and in Bulletin 23 will not be repeated here, so those documents should be consulted for additional information. There are two exceptions that are discussed in more detail here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The calculation of vertical wind is described in more detail below for the variables WI and WIC.<br />
</li>
<li>Because measurements obtained by a GPS receiver are often used, the motion of the GPS receiving antenna relative to the IRU must be considered. Standard processing corrects for the motion of the gust system relative to the IRU arising from aircraft rotation, but a similar correction is needed because the GPS antenna is displaced from the IRU. The displacement is almost entirely along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, so GPS-measured velocities like GGVNS, GGVEW, and GGVSPD (denoted here <span class="math inline">\(v_n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_u\)</span>) need correction as follows to give measurements that apply at the location of the IRU. Then these variables can be used in place of or to complement similar measurements from the IRU in the processing algorithms. The equations are:<br />
<span class="math display" id="eq:deltav">\[\begin{align}\begin{split}
\delta v_{u} = &amp; -L_{G}\dot{\theta}\notag \\
\delta v_{e} = &amp; -L_{G}\dot{\psi}\,{\cos\psi}\notag \\
\delta v_{n} = &amp;  L_{G}\dot{\psi}\,{\sin\psi}
\end{split}
\tag{4.55}
\end{align}\]</span><br />
where <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> respectively are the pitch and heading angles and <span class="math inline">\(L_G\)</span> is the distance forward along the longitudinal axis from the IRU to the GPS antenna (<span class="math inline">\(−4.30\)</span> m for the GV and <span class="math inline">\(-9.88\)</span> m for the C-130 during and after 2015). The negative signs indicate that the GPS antennas are behind the IRUs. The dots over the attitude-angle symbols represent time derivatives, so for example <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\theta}\)</span> is the rate of change of the pitch angle. All angles are expressed in radians. The correction terms should be added to the GPS-measured velocity components so that they represent the motion of the IRU relative to the Earth. This is done for the vertical wind, beginning in 2017, but for horizontal wind the complementary filter (discussed below) removes high-frequency fluctuations from the GPS-derived measurements so incorporation of these changes would have negligible effect.

<p>Wind is measured by adding two vectors, the measured air motion relative to the aircraft (called the relative wind) and the motion of the aircraft relative to the Earth. The following are the measurements used to determine the relative wind. The motion of the aircraft relative to the ground was discussed in Section <a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#inertial-reference-systems">3.1</a>, and the combination of these two vectors to measure the wind is described in <a href="https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/archives%3A8152">RAF Bulletin 23</a>.</p>
<p>RAF uses the radome<span id="radome gust-sensing system" label="radome gust-sensing system"></span> gust-sensing technique<a href="#fn36" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a>
to measure incidence angles of the relative wind (i.e., angles of attack and sideslip). The pressure difference between sensing ports above and below the center line of the radome is used, along with the dynamic pressure measured at a pitot tube and referenced to the static pressure source, to determine the angle of attack. The sideslip angle is determined similarly using the pressure ports on the starboard and port sides of the radome. A Rosemount Model 858AJ gust probe has occasionally been used for specialized measurements. The radome measurements are made by differential pressure sensors located in the nose area of the aircraft and connected to the radome by semi-rigid tubing.</p>

<h4>Mach Number (dimensionless): MACHx, MACHX<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#mach-number" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>The Mach Number that characterizes the flight speed.</em> The Mach number is defined as the ratio of the flight speed (or the magnitude of the relative wind) to the speed of sound.
See Eq. <a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#eq:M2">(4.17)</a> for the equation used. The letter ‘x’ refers to the location, typically ‘F’ (fuselage) or ‘R’ (radome). The measurement from a special pitot-static sensor is denoted “FT” for fuselage-top. Many relatively old archived data files have instead a variable XMACH2, which is the square of MACHx.</p>

<h4>Aircraft True Airspeed (m/s): TASx, TASX, TAS_A, TASDRY<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#true-airspeed" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><em>The flight speed of the aircraft relative to the atmosphere.</em> This derived measurement of the flight speed of the aircraft relative to the atmosphere is based on the Mach number calculated using the dynamic pressure at location x, the static pressure, and the measured water vapor pressure. See the derivation for ATx . The different variables for TASx (TASF, TASR, etc) use different measurements of QCxC in the calculation of Mach number. The variable TASDRY is the result of calculations for which the Mach number, air temperature, and true airspeed are determined for dry instead of humid air. See the discussion of <a href="#ATX">ATX</a> for an explanation of how humidity is handled in the calculation of true airspeed. TASFLG is a data-quality flag indicating (by a value of 1 instead of normal 0) that the humidity correction or another input to TASX has a problem and has been flagged as unreliable. This often occurs because the humidity measured by a dew-point instrument is above the equilibrium value for the measured temperature. An alternate measure of true airspeed provided directly by the aircraft avionics system is TAS_A; this variable is apparently filtered in the avionic system and therefore is missing some of the high-frequency signal present in TASx from the research data system. The avionics system also provides a variable called CAS_A, which represents “Calibrated Airspeed”. That variable applies calibrations to the “indicated airspeed,” which is determined from the difference between dynamic pressure sensed at a pitot tube and static pressure sensed by static sources on the fuselage. Calibrated airspeed represents the flight speed that, for standard flight conditions of 1013.25 hPa and 15<sup>o</sup>C, would produce the measured pressure difference after calibration for measurement errors.</p>

<em>The three-dimensional wind vector with respect to the earth,</em> as determined from the inertial reference systems. UI is the east-west component with positive values <u>toward</u> the east, VI is the north-south component with positive values <u>toward</u> the north, and WI is the vertical component with positive values toward the zenith.<br />
The calculation of WI differs from the description in Bulletin 23 because the output from the inertial reference system is different for the modern units now in use. The vertical wind is the sum of the vertical gust component (represented approximately by TASX sin((ATTACK-PITCH)<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>/180) if ATTACK and PITCH have dimensions of degrees) and the motion of the aircraft as measured by VSPD (discussed in Section <a href="the-state-of-the-aircraft.html#inertial-reference-systems">3.1</a>). Bulletin 23 describes the historical calculation of the vertical motion of the aircraft via a barometric-inertial feedback loop, but equivalent calculations (including pressure damping to the pressure altitude) are incorporated into current IRS units so VSPD already is the product of such a calculation. To calculate WI, VSPD is therefore used in place of the obsolete variable WP3 that was discussed in Bulletin 23.
<br />
WIC should usually be used instead of WI because VSPD, entering WI, is updated to the pressure altitude and so can have false variations in baroclinic conditions. WIC uses GGVSPD (or in some cases older GPS-based rate-of-climb variables) in place of VSPD and so is more reliable.<br />

<li id="fn25"><p>A problem sometimes arises from use of the measured humidity, because that measurement might be obviously in error. For example, following descents the dew point determined from chilled-mirror hygrometers sometimes overshoots the correct value significantly, producing dew-point measurements well above the measured temperature. If such measurements are used, the result can produce a significant error in derived variables based on the humidity-corrected gas constant and specific heats. If the measurements are flagged as bad, there will be gaps in derived variables. To avoid these two errors, the corrections applied to the gas constant and specific heats are treated as follows: (i) The humidity correction is limited to not more than that given by the water-equilibrium humidity at the temperature ATXD, calculated using dry-air specific heats and gas constant. (ii) If the humidity from the primary sensor is flagged as a missing measurement (e.g., from a dew-point sensor), a secondary measurement is used (e.g., the VCSEL) in cases when the secondary sensor is almost always present in an experiment. (iii) As a backup, the variables TASDRY and ATxD are always calculated omitting the humidity correction to the gas constant and the specific heats. These variables usually provide continuous measurements, although they will be offset from the humidity-corrected values. The offset indicates the magnitude of the correction when both are present, and one of the variables TASxD (ATxD) may be selected as TASX (ATX) in cases where missing values might cause a problem for derived variables.<a href="the-state-of-the-atmosphere.html#fnref25" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
