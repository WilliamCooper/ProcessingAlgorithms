              RAF Technical Note: Processing Algorithms

This repository contains the text files for the RAF Technical Note on
processing algorithms that are used for processing data collected
on the RAF research aircraft. The variables that appear in archived
data are defined here, and the algorithms used in their calculation
are described. This document does not describe the instrumentation
used, but there are many links to such descriptions. The goal of this
document is to describe both current and past algorithms, so it is
expected that this document will be modified often so that it can
remain current.
