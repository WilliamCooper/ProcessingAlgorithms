CPS\index{CPS=counts per second} = counts per second from the instrument  
[O$_{3}$]$_{wet}$ = ozone mixing ratio as measured in the sensing
cell (with water)  
[O$_{3}$]$_{dry}$ = ozone mixing ratio in dry air, corrected
for the effects of water vapor  
$S(t)$ = sensitivity at time t = (CPS when exposed to cal gas)
/ concentration of cal gas  
$Z(t)$ = background at time t = CPS when exposed to zero-ozone
air
